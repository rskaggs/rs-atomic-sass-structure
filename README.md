RS Atomic Sass Structure
========================

A Starting Point for my Sass files upon creating a new project.

This was based upon Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

Quarks folder naming convention delightfully taken from Robin Rendle's 
Smashing Magazine article [The "Other" Interface: Atomic Design With Sass](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/02/other-interface-atomic-design-sass/)
I use this term a little differently. To me the quarks are not the default unclassed elements, 
but the parts of our SASS and CSS that are not tied to a specific element (e.g. variables, placeholders, mixins, fonts, etc..).
